IPv6 is increasingly important, as the world transitions to a more connected, secure and scalable internet. While IPv4 still reigns supreme in terms of volume of usage, IPv6 adoption is steadily increasing, with tech giants and ISPs in particular pushing for more widespread IPv6 uptake and integration.

Read on to find out more about IPv6, how it is supported at Scaleway, and how you can configure your resources and infrastructure to take full advantage of this modern protocol.

## What is IPv6?

**IP**, or **Internet Protocol** enables machines to locate and communicate with each other on networks like the Internet or private subnets, by assigning each connected machine a unique IP address. An IP address is a set of numbers to identify the machine on the network. 

The most commonly recognized and most widely-used IP version is **IPv4**, launched in 1983. Each IPv4 address has 32 bits. Written in human-readable form, an IPv4 address is generally shown as four octets separated by periods, e.g. `151.115.59.87`. However, with the growing number of machines connected to the Internet, the world is literally running out of unique IPv4 addresses - only 4.3 billion unique addresses of this format are possible. 

This is where **IPv6** comes in, the most recent version of the IP protocol. Each IPv6 address has 128 bits, meaning a pool of  Written in human-readable form, an IPv6 address can be shown as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, each group representing 16 bits and separated by a colon, e.g. `2001:0DB8:0000:0003:0000:01FF:0000:002E`. This can also be notated as `2001:DB8::3:0:1FF:0:2E`.

As well as providing a much bigger address space, IPv6 also includes a built-in network security layer (IPsec), as well as improved features for reliability and efficiency, liked autoconfiguration, streamlined headers and improved Quality of Service (QoS). All leading to a more robust and secure protocol, that can potentially offer lower latency and faster data transfer. 

## IPv6-compatible products

The following products support IPv6:

### Instances and IPv6

Scaleway Instances are compatible with IPv6, with the caveat that the Instance must be using [routed IPs](/compute/instances/concepts/#routed-flexible-ip). Recently created Instances use routed IPs by default, older Instances may need to be [moved manually to routed IPs](/compute/instances/how-to/migrate-routed-ips/).

### Public IPv6 

You can attach one or multiple public (flexible) IPv6 addresses to your Instance, as well as, or instead of, a public IPv4 address. These public addresses are flexible, meaning that you can detach them from an Instance, hold them in your account, and attach them to a different Instance later, if you want. Each flexible IPv6 address is a `/64` IPv6 subnet.

### Private IPv6 

When you attach an Instance to a Private Network, it gets both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address on that network. You can either let IPAM auto-allocate any available address, or specify a [reserved IP address](/network/ipam/how-to/reserve-ip/) to use.

- [Using routed IPs](/compute/instances/api-cli/using-routed-ips/)
- [Fix lost IPv6 connectivity when migrating to routed IP for [old Debian Buster images](/instances/troubleshooting/fix-lost-ip-connectivity-on-debian-buster/) or [RHEL images](/compute/instances/troubleshooting/fix-unreachable-ipv6-rhel-based-instance/)
- [Fix DNS resolution with a routed IPv6-only setup on Debian Bullseye](/compute/instances/troubleshooting/fix-dns-routed-ipv6-only-debian-bullseye/)

### Elastic Metal and IPv6

Scaleway Elastic Metal servers are compatible with IPv6. 

### Public IPv6

You can attach one or multiple public (flexible) IPv6 addresses to your Elastic Metal server, as well as, or instead of, a public IPv4 address. These public addresses are flexible, meaning that you can detach them from an Elastic Metal server, hold them in your account, and attach them to a different Elastic Metal server, if you want. Each flexible IPv6 address is a `/64` IPv6 subnet. Flexible IPv6 addresses can also be used as additional IP addresses to create virtual machines on your Elastic Metal server.

### Private IPv6 

When you attach an Elastic Metal server to a Private Network, it gets both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address on that network. You also use IPAM's [reserve a private IP](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/ipam/#path-ips-reserve-a-new-ip) and [attach a reserved IP to a custom resource](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/ipam/#path-ips-attach-ip-to-custom-resource) feature to attach an IPv6 address to a named resource via its MAC address, suitable for ensuring virtual machines on your Elastic Metal server get private IPv6 addresses.

### Dedibox and IPv6

The Scaleway Dedibox network fully supports IPv6. IPv6 can serve as your serverâ€™s primary IP and also as a failover IP utilizing the concept of a virtual MAC address.
