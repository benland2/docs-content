IPv6 is increasingly important, as the world transitions to a more connected, secure and scalable internet. While the ever-popular IPv4 protocol still reigns supreme for now in terms of volume of usage, IPv6 adoption is steadily increasing, with tech giants and ISPs in particular pushing for more widespread IPv6 uptake and integration.

Read on to find out more about IPv6, how it is supported at Scaleway, and how you can configure your resources and infrastructure to take full advantage of this modern protocol.

## What is IPv6?

**IP**, or **Internet Protocol** enables machines to locate and communicate with each other on networks like the Internet or private subnets, by assigning each connected machine a unique IP address. An IP address is a set of numbers to identify the machine on the network. 

The most commonly recognized and most widely-used IP version is **IPv4**, launched in 1983. Each IPv4 address has 32 bits. Written in human-readable form, an IPv4 address is generally shown as four octets separated by periods, e.g. `151.115.59.87`. However, with the growing number of machines connected to the Internet, the world is literally running out of unique IPv4 addresses - only 4.3 billion unique addresses of this format are possible. 

This is where **IPv6** comes in, the most recent version of the IP protocol. Each IPv6 address has 128 bits, meaning a pool of  Written in human-readable form, an IPv6 address can be shown as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, each group representing 16 bits and separated by a colon, e.g. `2001:0DB8:0000:0003:0000:01FF:0000:002E`. This can also be notated as `2001:DB8::3:0:1FF:0:2E`.

As well as providing a much bigger address space, IPv6 also includes a built-in network security layer (IPsec), as well as improved features for reliability and efficiency, liked autoconfiguration, streamlined headers and improved Quality of Service (QoS). All leading to a more robust and secure protocol, that can potentially offer lower latency and faster data transfer.
